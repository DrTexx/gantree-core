## Important Note

It is highly recommended that you create your own configurations based on existing samples. This tutorial serves as a step-by-step explanation of alternatively creating a config from scratch in an effort to cover each aspect required.

For the average user, everything you need should be covered by [basics](./basics.md) and [samples](./samples.md). If you're having issues however, this document may help.

## Polkadot Example

We're going to create a Gantree config, so we need to create a new `.json` file. In this tutorial, we're going to call it `polkadot_tutorial.json`.

Inside our file, we're going first going to want to specify which schema version our Gantree config will be under the `metadata` root-level key.

```jsonc
{
  "metadata": {
    "version": "2.0"
  }
}
```

We also want to add the name of our project here. This will be used as a unique identifier in Gantree's logic, and be used as a name base for nodes with various operations.

```jsonc
{
  "metadata": {
    "version": "2.0",
    "project": "polkadot_tutorial"
  }
}
```

Next we want to specify everything regarding the binary we'll be running on our nodes. This will all be under a root-level key, `"binary": {}`.

We're going to specify whether this this binary should use a specific value for it's `--chain` argument, or whether it should not use a `--chain` argument. We're going to use the default chain, so we specify `"chain": false`.

We also need to specify the method which Gantree should use to get the binary. We're going to be compiling from a repository, so we add the key `"repository": {}`.

**Note:** If you would rather use a different method, such as downloading an already compiled binary (fetch method), please consult the [basics](./basics.md) documentation.

Inside the `repository` object, we specify a the url of the repository we want to use (`url`), and the version of the repository to use (`version`).

In our case, we'll use the url `https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot` for the polkadot repository, and the version `head` so we're compiling the latest commit from the default branch.

```jsonc
{
  "metadata": {
    "version": "2.0",
    "project": "s-r-do-pol-kus"
  },
  "binary": {
    "chain": false,
    "repository": {
      "url": "https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot",
      "version": "HEAD"
    }
  }
}
```

Now we need to specify what the name of the binary will be once it's compiled, and whether we should use the binaries default chainspec, or our own.

We'll set our `filename` to `polkadot`, and `useBinChainSpec` to `true`.

```jsonc
{
  "metadata": {
    "version": "2.0",
    "project": "s-r-do-pol-kus"
  },
  "binary": {
    "chain": false,
    "repository": {
      "url": "https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot",
      "version": "HEAD"
    },
    "filename": "polkadot",
    "useBinChainSpec": "true"
  }
}
```

Lastly, we need to specify a `"nodes": []` root-level key in the form of an array. Inside this array we'll specify an object for each of the nodes in our network.

```jsonc
{
  "metadata": {
    "version": "2.0",
    "project": "s-r-do-pol-kus"
  },
  "binary": {
    "chain": false,
    "repository": {
      "url": "https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot",
      "version": "HEAD"
    },
    "filename": "polkadot",
    "useBinChainSpec": "true"
  },
  "nodes": [
  ]
}
```

We'll create a new item in this array in the form of an object, and start adding keys.

Our node object isn't going to be a validator, so we specify `"validator": "false"`.

Now we need to specify the infrastructure the node will be created on, so we add an `"instance": {}` key to our node object.

In our case, we're going to use the provider Digital Ocean, so we'll add a `"provider"` key to the instance object with the value `"do"`.

```jsonc
{
  "metadata": {
    "version": "2.0",
    "project": "s-r-do-pol-kus"
  },
  "binary": {
    "chain": false,
    "repository": {
      "url": "https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot",
      "version": "HEAD"
    },
    "filename": "polkadot",
    "useBinChainSpec": "true"
  },
  "nodes": [
    {
      "validator": false,
      "instance": {
        "provider": "do",
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The rest of the keys in `"instance": {}"` are dependant on the provider specified, so if you wanted to use a different provider you would need to specify it's specific keys. Consult [basics](./basics.md) for more information.

Next, we'll specify the size and region of the droplet we're creating, in addition to the path to the private key that will be used to access the instance during operations or debugging.

```jsonc
{
  "metadata": {
    "version": "2.0",
    "project": "s-r-do-pol-kus"
  },
  "binary": {
    "chain": false,
    "repository": {
      "url": "https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot",
      "version": "HEAD"
    },
    "filename": "polkadot",
    "useBinChainSpec": "true"
  },
  "nodes": [
    {
      "validator": false,
      "instance": {
        "provider": "do",
        "dropletSize": "s-6vcpu-16gb",
        "region": "nyc3",
        "sshPrivateKeyPath": "$env:GANTREE_INSTANCE_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Here we've specified the path to our private key as a reference to an environment variable, so we need to ensure it's been exported before running any Gantree operations.

You should now have a working Gantree configuration for a polkadot node!

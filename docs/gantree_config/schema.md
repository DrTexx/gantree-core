## Schema

Gantree configurations must conform to the structure outlined in the schema found here:

- [Gantree config schema](../../src/schemas/gantree_config_schema.json)

As this file is used for configuration validation, it will often be the most accurate representation of the required structure for a given commit/release.

In the event that the samples/documentation are outdated/incompatible, the schema is invaluable reference for debugging.
